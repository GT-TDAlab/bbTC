## How to build

Create a `build` subdirectory and run `cmake` and `make` from there like

    cmake ..
    make -j

Note that bbTC targets CPU+GPU execution environments. Hence, if Cuda runtime is
installed in the machine than `nvcc` is used for compilation and outputs an
executable that runs on CPUs and GPUs. Otherwise, `g++` is used for compilation
and outputs an executable that runs on CPUs.

### Dependencies

This project depends on NVIDIA's Cuda Compiler (nvcc) a version greater than
9.0, GCC a version greater than 7.0.0, OpenMP, PIGO I/O library, and SARMA
partitioning library. PIGO and SARMA libraries included under utils directory.
For detailed information:

- [PIGO Library](https://github.com/GT-TDAlab/PIGO)
- [SARMA Library](https://github.com/GT-TDAlab/SARMA)

## How to run

bbTC accepts edge lists, matrix market files, and saved binary CSR files.
bbTC accepts `.bbtc` a binary CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) formatted graph.
Note that if the given graph in text form then after the first execution bbTC
writes binary CSR format of that graph by appending `.bbtc` to the filename.

    --graph <path>        Path for the graph file.                   ()
                            Supported formats: edge lists, matrix
                            market files and binary CSR.

    --ngpu <int>          Number of GPUs to use                      (all)
                            Note: if 0 then only CPUs used.
    --nstream <int>       Number of streams per GPU                  (4)

    --border <int>        Work queue border for GPUs                 (|T|/2)
                            Note: if set to -1, GPUs process all.
    --copy-first          If set then copy graph to GPUs first       (false)
    --repeat <int>        Run bbTC algorithm '--repeat' times        (5)

    Examples:
    bbtc --graph email-EuAll_adj.mtx --partitioner n1d --ncut 4
